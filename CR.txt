Hi :)

First of all, I'm using JetBrains PhpStorm as my IDE. It's called PHPstorm but it's like their product WebStorm but with
php and some more additions. It's great for any web development I think, and has great features.
For example, I used it for formatting index.html. (Using ctrl+alt+l and ctrl+alt+o)

Second of all, to view the final output (an actual web page) I used an npm* package called http-server, which I found
here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6084360/using-node-js-as-a-simple-web-server.


* npm is a package-control software (like pip and nuget) which has a great cli and is used a lot in web development.
  Read about it more online.
